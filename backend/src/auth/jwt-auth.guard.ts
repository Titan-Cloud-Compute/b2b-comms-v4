 * Throws 401 when the cookie is missing or the signature is invalid on
 * non-public routes.
 *
 * READ-ONLY IMPERSONATION: when the session carries `impersonatedBy` (an admin
 * viewing the app as a firm), mutating requests are rejected with 403 so the
 * admin cannot write as the firm (talk to agents, edit data, …). Exemptions:
 * the exit-impersonation/logout routes (the admin must always get back out)
 * and the integration route groups (IMPERSONATION_WRITE_PREFIXES) — admins
 * deliberately set up integrations on the firm's behalf via "View as company". Enforced HERE — rather than a standalone global guard —
 * because JwtAuthGuard is the sole interception point that runs on every
 * authenticated route AND has already populated `req.session` (there is no
 * global APP_GUARD in this app).
